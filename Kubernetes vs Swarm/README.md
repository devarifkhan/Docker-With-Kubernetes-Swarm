# Kubernetes or Swarm

- Kubernetes and swarm are both container orchestration tools. They help in managing a cluster of containers. They are used to manage the lifecycle of containers, such as deployment, scaling, and networking.
- Both are solid platforms with vendor backing. Kubernetes is backed by Google, while Docker Swarm is backed by Docker.
- Swarm: Easier to deploy / Manage
- Kubernetes: More features and flexibility

# Advantage of Swarm

- Comes with Docker, single vendor container platform
- Easiest orchestra to deploy/manage yourself
- Follow 80/20 rule, 20% of features for 80% use cases
- Runs anywhere Docker does
- Secure by default 
- Easier to troubleshoot

# Advantage of Kubernetes

- Clouds will deploy/manage kubernetes for you
- Infrastructure vendors are making their own distributions
- Widest adoption and community
- Flexible: Covers widest set of use cases
- Kubernetes first vendor support
