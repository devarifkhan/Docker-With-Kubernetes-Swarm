# Build your own image

- Dockerfiles are part process workflow and part art
- Take existing Node.js app and Dockerize it
- Make Dockerfile. Build it. Test it. Push it. ( rm it ). Run it.
- Expect this to be iterative. Rarely do I get it right the first time.
- Use the Alpine version of Node.js to keep the image size small
- Expected result is website at http://localhost
- Tag and push to your Docker Hub account ( free )
- Remove your image from local cache, run again from hub
